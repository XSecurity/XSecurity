### XSecurity (Checkers)
A security plug-in in Xcode with Clang analyzer's checkers for iOS application development. This readme is purely related to Checkers, for details about the plug-in please see the [README](https://github.com/XSecurity/XSecurity) file under the main folder.


##### PREPARATION
_____________________________

We included a Clang binary with these checkers pre-built in it. If you want to just use the checkers right away, clone this repository and proceed to [INSTALLATION](#install). 

**NOTE: Before cloning this repository!**

- *If you plan to* **contribute** *to this project we highly suggest that you follow [this guide](https://github.com/XSecurity/XSecurity/blob/master/checker/BUILD_CLANG_AND_HELP.md) instead.* 
- *If you* **just want to build** *it yourself and don't want reflect your changes,* **carry on!.**

We believe that it is better for you to build the original Clang first. Then, include the checkers from this repository and build Clang again. In this way you can tell whether your setup is working in the first place or not.
We plan to automate things for you but for the meantime please bear with us by following this procedure.


######Get The Required Tools.

- See [Getting Started with the LLVM System - Requirements.](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements)
- Note that Python is needed for running the test suite. You can get it [here:](http://www.python.org/download)

######Checkout LLVM:

- Change directory to where you want the llvm directory placed. This will be your [llvm working folder](#llvm_working_folder)
- We've been using the revision 200605, thus the use of -r option.

Accordingly can be done by doing...

    $ cd < llvm working folder > 
    $ svn co -r 200605 http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm 


######Checkout Clang:

    $ cd ./llvm/tools
    $ svn co -r 200605 http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang 

Checkout extra Clang Tools: (optional)

    $ cd ../../llvm/tools/clang/tools
    $ svn co -r 200605 http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra/trunk extra 

Checkout Compiler-RT:

    $ cd ../../../../llvm/projects
    $ svn co -r 200605 http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt 

######Build LLVM and Clang: 

To build without polluting the source directory

    $ cd ../..
    $ mkdir build  
    $ cd build

**Note:** The following may take little while. This is to configure the build folder which is outside the source directory.

    $ ../llvm/configure --enable-optimized --disable-compiler-version-checks

**Note:** At this point if you are able to successfully execute the above mentioned command after executing the following make command, then you might want to have a coffee break or do something else since it will take time to complete.

    $ make

By now you may have a similar folder structure as the following: <a name="llvm_working_folder" />(llvm working folder -> "some_folder" below)
        
    ___some_folder             <- llvm working folder 
    |____build
    | |____Release+Asserts
    | | |____bin
    | |____scripts
    |
    |____llvm
    | |____tools
    | | |____clang
    | | | |____lib
    | | | | |____StaticAnalyzer
    | | | | | |____Checkers
    | | | |
    | | | |____tools
    | | | | |____scan-build

######Clone the Repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/XSecurity/XSecurity.git ./XSecurity

<a name="repo_root" />(repo root folder -> "XSecurity" below, <a name="checker_folder" />checker folder -> "checker" below)

    __XSecurity               <- repo root folder
    |____checker              <- checker folder
    | |____build
    | | |____Release+Asserts
    | | | |____bin
    | | |____scripts
    | |
    | |____llvm
    | | |____tools
    | | | |____clang
    | | | | |____lib
    | | | | | |____StaticAnalyzer
    | | | | | | |____Checkers
    | | | | |
    | | | | |____tools
    | | | | | |____scan-build
    | |  
    | |____test
    | 
    |____plug-in
    | |____XSecurity
    | | |____XSecurity
    

######Overwrite the llvm working folder with Repo Files

**NOTE:  If you are using the most recent version of Clang and need to use the recent Checkers**

- Before overwriting the files, please take note of Checkers.td and CMakeLists.txt in llvm/tools/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers of [llvm working folder](#llvm_working_folder). We suggest that you do not overwrite it right away, if you have the latest llvm source code and the authors may have addded more checkers compared to the checkers we have when we created our checkers.
- It is highly advised that you compare the two versions of the said files and add only the portion applicable to MSecIOSAppSec.

Copy the contents of [checker folder](#checker_folder) to your [llvm working folder](#llvm_working_folder).

    $ cp -ir < checker folder >/* < llvm working folder >/*  


######Rebuild Clang 

Build Clang again in [llvm working folder](#llvm_working_folder)/build

    $ cd < llvm working folder >/build
    $ make

To confirm if the iOSAppSec checkers were built successfully execute the following under the same build folder.
It will show you the list of the iOSAppSec checkers (there are 11 checkers at the time of this writing)

    $ ./scripts/confirm_checker.sh iOSAppSec


##### <a name="install"/>INSTALLATION
_____________________________

You should do the following after succesfully building Clang, under [llvm working folder](#llvm_working_folder)'s build folder 
(the one with files in this repository) 
- Quit Xcode if it is running.
- Execute [llvm working folder](#llvm_working_folder)/build/scripts/install.sh 

##### SMOKE TEST the CHECKERS in Xcode
_____________________________
Open Xcode, open the test project called CLangTest. You can find CLangTest in [checker folder](#checker_folder)/test. Follow the following guide to run the checkers. 

##### RUNNING the CHECKERS in Xcode
_____________________________

Open Xcode and find "XSecurity" in the main menu, typically it is located before the "Window" or "Help" menu item. If you can't find the XSecurity menu then the plug-in is not loaded/installed successfully. Under "XSecurity", you can find the last menu item, "Static Security Analyzer: Analyze". Select it to run the checkers". You would know if it work if there are no errors and some security issues are being displayed. 

If you find errors similar to the following, just delete the specified pcm file and typically it should work, we will be happy if you let us know if it doesn't work.
